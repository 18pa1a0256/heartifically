  <h2><i><u>The Problem</u></i></h2>
  “17.9 Million people die each year from CVD’s (10% from India), an estimated 31% of all deaths worldwide” - WHO

  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cardio Vascular Diseases(CVDs) are the number one cause of mortality and morbidity globally as access to Healthcare is a major problem.</li>
    <li>It is difficult for Doctors currently to access the health parameters and compliance of a CVD patient on a longterm basis.</li>
    <li>No dedicated Digital ecosystem for CVD patients and no platform that provides awareness on life supporting measures during emergencies.</li>
    <li>It is estimated that a severe CVD patient spends around 3 to 5 Lakh INR per year and 40,000 INR for a non severe patient per year.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2><i><u>The Solution</u></i></h2>
